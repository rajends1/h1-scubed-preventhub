                   <p>When he was eight years old, Adam was asked by the Prevent officers at school if he knew the Qur’an. He was then asked to recite verses he had memorised. The officers then questioned him for about an hour, alone. He told his parents they mainly asked him about his religion.”

                <p“When key funders insisted a grassroots community organisation undergo Prevent training, they refused because engaging with Prevent would destroy the trust and respect they relied upon to work. They did not get the funding and had to close key services to the community.”

                <li>Prevent started as being targeted at the Muslim community – now it has expanded to include charities and aid groups, as well as dissenters who challenge aspects of democracy. </li>
                <li>Whether you work in a community organisation, or are linked to a charity or aid group, or even if you serve a mosque, these resources and cases illustrate you are not alone. </li>
